The application intends to keep the interface and design quality without sacrificing the security and privacy of the users. Also, they intend to use well established protocols **(XMPP)**, and avoid the use of Google Accounts, requiring the fewest permissions possible.

**Feedback** is given through an XMPP group chat, with the developers and some users. Additionally, comments in Daniel Gultsch’s [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/inputmice) also allows the team to **better understand** the problems with the application, as well as improvements and new features.

Although there are no deadlines so ever, is necessary to have some kind of **validation** in relation to the contributions work, in order to help the project to grow.

As Mr Daniel Gultsch said to us throught email *"yes my project is open for pull requests"*, there is no barrier stoping contribuitors to develop **new features** to the app or solve some bugs.
But the code needs to be **approved by the owner of the project**,Daniel Gultsch by **pull request** in order to became part of the project code.
