### Software Architecture and the 4+1 Architectural View Model

**Software Architecture** documents the fundamental structures of a **software system**. These structures include the elements of the system, as well as **the relations between them**.

The **4+1 Architectural View Model** describes software systems from several **different view points**, such as **users**, **developers**, **project managers**, etc. The 4 views in this model are logical, development, process and physical view.

In the **development** view we model the software from the programmer's perspective, so it centers around the software management.

The **logical** view represents the funcionalities provided for the end-user.

In the **physical** view we'll illustrate the system from the system engineer's prespective. Because of that, it will feature the software components on the physical layer and the actual connections between them.

The **process** view is concerned with the communication between the system processes and their runtime behaviour.
