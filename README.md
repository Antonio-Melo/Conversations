### Software Testability and Reviews


### Test Statistics and analytics
The Conversations app doesn’t have **any tests implemented**. All testing seems to be based on usage. Anyone can report a bug, which will be included in the issues tab in GitHub.

Knowing the importance of testing your code, we think there should be a **more formal and quantifiable** way to test the app. And even though the tests should be written before the code itself, we recommend the implementation of **automated** tests.

We also think it’s best to start developing any new features this way. Because even if the rest of the code isn’t formally tested, these new features can still be treated as components in **Regression** tests. And so the developers can be sure they are building **reliable** code.

The whole process of thinking up the tests will also ensure that the feature is well thought out, which in turn will result in smaller implementation time.
For these tests we recommend **unit** testing followed by some **white-box** testing, since it’s a straightforward way of testing code and the developers of Conversations don’t seem to want to spend a lot of time on tests.
