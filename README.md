## Software Maintainability
###### SIG metrics

Software Maintainability in software engineering is described as a process to **improve** software already made.
This process allows the correction and **prevention** of bugs, system changes and new features required.
This provides changes to the code that will **not** be visible in the comportament of the software, but will allow in the future that new features are implemented more **easily** and with **less** costs.

In order to evaluate the quality of **Conversations**, we used [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com). This tool allows us to determinate factors like readability and anticipate/minimize future problems(**Future-proofing**).
A list of points is **analized** in the code:
- Write **Short** Units of Code
- Write **Simple** Units of Code
- Write Code **Once**
- Keep Unit Interfaces **Small**
- **Separate** Concerns in Modules
- Couple Architecture Components **Loosely**
- Keep Architecture Components **Balanced**
- Keep Your **Codebase** Small
- Automate **Tests**
- Write **Clean** Code

Conversations has alot of methods that require a **long list of arguments**, as we see above.
The amount of arguments should be **smaller**, in order to make the use of the same more **intuitive**.
We recomend to group the information in **appropriate structures** becaming the code more **organized** an **readable**.

The last point were Conversations fail is in **automate tests**. The project has none, not even a single line of code coverd.
We think that is a important problem that should be solved very soon.
This could show the solution to futere problems.
